# Comprehensive Banking Analytics

## Project Overview

The Comprehensive Banking Analytics project aims to leverage advanced data analytics techniques to extract valuable insights and enhance decision-making processes within the banking sector. The project addresses key components including customer segmentation, credit risk assessment, and performance prediction using clustering, classification, and regression models.

## Key Components

### 1. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

- Utilize clustering algorithms to group customers based on banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
- Explore and visualize customer segments to understand patterns and behaviors.

### 2. Credit Risk Assessment (Classification)

- Develop a credit scoring system using classification algorithms.
- Train the model on historical data to predict the likelihood of default or late payments.
- Integrate machine learning models into the credit approval process for enhanced risk management.

### 3. Performance Prediction (Regression)

- Build regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution.
- Analyze the impact of various factors on the bank's performance, such as economic indicators and market trends.
- Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation and investment strategies.

## Dataset

- Acquire and preprocess a comprehensive banking dataset, ensuring data quality and handling missing values.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.

## Technological Stack

- Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and modeling.
- Pandas Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- Visualization tools such as Matplotlib or Seaborn for data exploration.
- Streamlit Library used for building the user interface. 

## Deliverables

- Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.
- A comprehensive report summarizing the findings, model performances, and recommendations for the banking institution.
